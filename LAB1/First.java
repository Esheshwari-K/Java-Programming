class First{

        //println will send the text to next line coz it works as \n no needa insert \n
System.out.println("Hello World"); //class=system, println=function 
System.out.print("Hello World\n");//instead of println we can use \n
System.out.print("Hello World");
System.out.println("Hello World\n From \nApni Kaksha");//space before from is bcz of space in print statement after \n
